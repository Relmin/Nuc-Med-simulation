# Nuc-Med-simulation
Working on a simulation for my medical education program. This is my first project ever, any tips or help is greatly appreciated!

Here is my post that I made on the godot beginner's help discord, for record keeping:

Hello! I am extremely brand new to Godot and I am floundering at the first basic aspects of my project. I have done the coding from zero tutorial, read through a ton of the Godot Docs on their website, built the dodge the creeps tutorial 2D, and have been attempting to build my project after that.

I am an educator working in medical imaging, and I am trying to make a simulation that I can use in the classroom. The simulation is a 17 segment bullseye that I want to be able to change the color of each segment individually or in three large groups. On top of that I want to let the user change from a heat map to greyscale for the colors.

Right now I am struggling to get started with connecting my nodes and switching between scenes. I feel like I am deep in over my head, but I have not been able to find much to help me figure out how to do the things I want to do.

My main questions are:
1. If I make an array that holds the color IDs for the heat map and the greyscale, is there a way to make that easily referenceable across the entire project?
2. How do I get a slider to change the color of the nodes?
3. How do I switch from the main scene (first UI screen) and the simulation scene (bullseye diagram) and back? I am struggling to figure out how to move between scenes instead of just having one massive scene and turning UI elements on and off.

I have posted the picture of the main simulation scene I am making. There are two menu buttons that produce pop-ups for "heat map" and "grey scale", the slider set up will eventually be to allow the user to switch between 3 slider set up or the 17 slider set up.

Any ideas or assistance would be greatly apprecaited. I have attached the coding I have done so far, I am not sure if I am doing things in the correct or best ways but I have been trying to follow the style guide and the docs I have been reading. Any ideas on better tutorials to lead me in the right direction are also appreciated, I am really looking for anything that can push this project along for me.

I am working on this project for my master's degree in education, so I have a lot of teaching knowledge but this is my first coding project. I have played around a bit here and there so I know a lot of terminology, but I just am really struggling to get everything to communicate. I understand how signals SHOULD work, but how to get them to actually connect is making me pull my hair out.

Thanks so much!
